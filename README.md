# Supply-Chain-Network-Optimizer-using-C++
Project Overview

The Supply Chain Network Optimizer is a C++ project designed to optimize supply chain operations by minimizing costs and improving efficiency. The project models a supply chain as a graph, with suppliers, warehouses, and retailers as nodes and transportation routes as weighted edges. Advanced graph algorithms are applied to determine the optimal delivery routes and network structure.

This project is ideal for supply chain management, logistics optimization, and operations research applications.
